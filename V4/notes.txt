UNIT 6

1) A new register will be added, in order to store exception types. The reason for this is for further information to show when an exception
is raised. This means that a new line must be added in the RaiseException() function in the processor.
Logical addresses are stored in the MAR register, and the limit register contains the process size.

2) In the exception handling funtion now new messages must appear, which will be chosen depending on the value of the new register.

3) Try to run a program with a NOP instruction. 

4) The simulator must be capable of detecting invalid system calls. Now, invalid system calls will mean the calling process to be killed, plus
the printing of a new message.
