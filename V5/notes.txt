UNIT 7

There would be 2 different reasons for processes to be in the blocked state.
One of the exercises would ask to allow processes to ask the OS to perform an IO operation.
The OS should do all the operations necessary to speak ith the device. Once that task is                                                                               
started, any other requests will be queued while the device is busy.
Processes waiting for the IO dvice will be sent o the blocked state.
The end of the IO operation will be signalled by means of an interrupt. A new kind of in-
terrupt should be specified.  At that moment, the next proces will be unblocked.
The IO operation should be recognized by means of the PID of the process.
